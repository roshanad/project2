## Project Workflow
##### How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?
- [ ] The `readme.md` file contains any necessary installation instructions
- The `planning` folder contains:
  - [ ] a picture / screenshot of your ERD (up to date!)
  - [ ] a `wireframes` directory, which in turn contains at least 2 drawings or photos of wireframes and ERDs
  - [x] a `user_stories.md` file, which in turn contains at least 7 user stories (or a link to a Trello board or equivalent)
- [x] A Github issue was submitted to the `project2` repository **by 11:00am on Friday, November 20<sup>th</sup>,** containing a link to a hosted video
- [ ] The video itself and/or the site on which it can be found contains a website or email address through which the creator can be contacted
- [x] The video is at least 3 minutes long, but **no more than** 5 minutes
- The video contains:
  - [x] A description and demo of the app
  - [x] A code sample explaining one thing of which the creator is proud
  - [x] One thing the creator would do differently next time
  - [x] The next feature the creator would like to implement
**Almost Meets Expectations** I know your planning docs exist, just not in the repo...

## Technical Requirements
##### How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?
- [x] App contains at least 2 models
- [x] App contains at least 1 association
- [x] At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes
- [x] Includes sign up, log in, and log out functionality
- [x] Utilizes an ORM to create database structure
**Meets Expectations**

## Creativity / Interface
##### How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?
- [x] The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS
- [x] The app delivers something of value to the end user: it is not just a login button and an index page
**Exceeds Expectations**

## Code Quality
##### How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?
- [x] The code follows style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indenting, modularity, and semantic naming
- [x] The code is commented only with what is necessary to document what is happening in the code
- [x] For any page, copying its source code as it appears in the **browser** and pasting it into the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) yields 0 errors
**Meets Expectations**

## Deployment and Functionality
##### How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?
- [x] Cursory use of the app by an uninformed user yields no errors that "break" it
- [x] The app is deployed to Heroku (or another hosting service)
- [x] The contents of the creator's Github repository is identical to that of the Heroku repository
- [ ] The `URL` field of the Github repository contains a link to the deployed version of the app

## Overall
**Meets Expectations** Such a polished app, Roshana! I love that you chose to take on something that's useful and meaningful to you and your community, and you have executed it really well. You could easily share this with real users right now, which is NOT always the case with these projects. By keeping the scope small, you were able to build something complete, professional-looking, and fully realized. And your SCSS is fantastic!

A couple of tiny UX-ish things: 1) Your "You have already signed in" flash message is hard to read because the dark color blends in with the background. 2) It would be great to have an "all" option in that row of categories at the top of the message board.

Please don't forget to upload your planning documents to a planning folder -- having the ERD, wireframes, and user stories in your repo shows potential employers that you have experience with managing a dev workflow.

Also, `heroku apps:rename nepalese-message-board --app nepalese-massage-board` will erase that little typo for you :-)
